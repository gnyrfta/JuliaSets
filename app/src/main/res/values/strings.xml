    <string name="infoJulia">About Julia sets. \n
Julia sets are the points created by iterating certain functions of complex numbers in this way: \n
z_0=a+bi\n
z_1=f(z_0)\n
z_2=f(z_1)\n
.\n
.\n
.\n
z_n=f(z_n-1)\n

If z converges as n -> inf then the z_0-value belongs to the set. \n
If z diverges for large n then the z_0-value does not belong to the set.\n

The functions used for iteration in this app are\n
f(z)=c*sin(z)\n
f(z)=c*cos(z)+c\n
f(z)=z^2+c\n
where c is a complex number that you specify in the app.
