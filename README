Program to generate Julia sets. 


About 

		About Julia sets. 

Julia sets are the points created by iterating certain functions of complex numbers in this way: 
z_0=a+bi
z_1=f(z_0) 
z_2=f(z_1)
.
.
.
z_n=f(z_n-1)
et.c...

If z converges as n -> inf then the z_0-value belongs to the set. 
If z diverges for large n then the z_0-value does not belong to the set.

The functions used for iteration in this app are
f(z)=c*sin(z)
f(z)=c*cos(z)+c
f(z)=z^2+c

where c is a complex number that you specify in the app. 

		Suggestions for c-values: 

Sine: 
1.0+0.1j
1.0+0.3j
Cosine:
1.0-0.5j
1.5708+0.94248j
1.5708+0.62832j
Quadratic:
-0.750+0j
-0.75-0.2j
-0.75+0.5j
